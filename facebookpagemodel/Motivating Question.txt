Motivating Question:
    "How do Facebook pages grow over time?"

Other side questions:
    "How do non-profit Facebook pages grow during the holiday season?" (Short-run analysis)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outline of Data:

    There are 9 pages being studied for this project. Each belonged to a non-profit and was managed by my company.

    Each of these pages was at a different level of development; some were established pillars in their community, while some were created in the time frame studied here.

    Values for each variable are grouped by week, with Week 0 starting on 11/8/16 and going for 12 weeks.

    My company's social media services were not fully worked out at the time, so this is a good opportunity to see how less motivated and less organized pages grow (or not) over time.

Variables:

    Time
    Growth (3 variables):
        Engagements     (Column E) [index 4]
        Likes           (Column C) [index 2]
        Reach           (Column H) [index 7]

    Confounding:
        Content:
            For the most part, our social media service was not set up entirely for all of these accounts. So, postings were not so frequent, and definitely not consistent across accounts.
        Christmas:
            Holiday season is known to be a season of giving and receiving - especially for non-profits
        First-fruits:
            Non-profit ministries may have more testimonials at start of year
        Post frequency:
            Not a measure of growth, but research shows that a positive correlation exists... may not be linear
        Elections and Politics:
            Date selection starts on election day - coincidence
            Subject matter of non-profits may be subtly politically oriented, increasing engagement
